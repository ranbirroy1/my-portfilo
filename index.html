            <h2>My Dream of Becoming a Web Designer
            </h2>
            <p>As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately
                pursue.It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first
                computer I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my
                grandma would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the
                functionality of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's
                technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I
                spent many contented hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.
                A few years later, my family moved. As we were no longer close enough to use my grandparent's computer,
                we purchased a new one for ourselves. I again used the computer for games and did some text editing,The up-to-date colors available meant
                that I could create fairly high-quality pictures. However, my limited paint program again handicapped my
                skills, its inadequate tools requiring me to draw every pixel manually, which proved very time
                consuming.</p>
